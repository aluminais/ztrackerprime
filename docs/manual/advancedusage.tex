\section{Synchronizing}

\subsection{Receiving Sync from a Hardware Sequencer}
\ztracker{} can receive MIDI clock synchronization from a specified MIDI port.
It will start and stop when the master sequencer is started/stopped. It will 
also follow MIDI song position pointer messages. Note however that the
latter does not work correctly if the song contains tempo changes or tpb
changes.

\subsection{Receiving Sync from a Software Sequencer}
  This works in the same manner as with the hardware sequencer, but you need
to have a software MIDI port which you can transfer the MIDI clocks through.
This is easily done by setting up Hubi's Loopback Device or MIDI Yoke.

\subsection{Sending Sync to External Equipment}
  \ztracker{} can send MIDI start/stop, and MIDI clock synchronization
to a specified MIDI port.  MIDI clocks occur 24 times per quarter note.
(24 ppqn).  These pulses can be used by external equipment to synchronize
to the tempo of \ztracker{}.
