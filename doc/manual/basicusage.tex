\section{The Pattern Editor}
Pressing \key{F2} bring up the pattern editor.
Let's begin by a showing a row in the pattern editor set to \emph{View mode:~Big}\ldots{}
\begin{verbatim}
E-2 00 7F 024 W2000
\end{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
\item [\texttt{E-2}] is the note itself.  In this case an E played in octave 2.
\item [\texttt{00}] is the instrument number.
\item [\texttt{7F}] is the velocity of this note.
\item [\texttt{024}] is the length of the note in subticks.
\item [\pc{W2000}] is a \emph{player command}. This particular command sets the
pitch bend to the center position.
\end{itemize}
The same row looks like this in \emph{View mode:~Regular}\ldots{}
\begin{verbatim}
E-2 00 7F 024
\end{verbatim}
\ldots{}like this in \emph{View mode:~FX}\ldots{}
\begin{verbatim}
E-2 7F W2000
\end{verbatim}
\ldots{}and like this in \emph{View mode:~Squish}
\begin{verbatim}
E-2 7F
\end{verbatim}

\section{Player Commands}

\subsubsection{Command \pc{A..xx}}
The player command \pc{A..xx} will set the ticks per beat value to \pc{xx},
where \pc{xx} is the tpb value in hexadecimal numbers.
The only allowed tpb values are 2 (\pc{02}), 4 (\pc{04}), 6 (\pc{06}), 8 (\pc{08}),
12 (\pc{0C}), 24 (\pc{18}) and 48 (\pc{30}).

\subsubsection{Command \pc{C..xx}}
When the player command \pc{C..xx} is encountered, the next tick the player
will skip to the next pattern in queue from row \pc{xx}, where \pc{xx} is the
row in hexadecimal numbers.

\subsubsection{Command \pc{D..xx}}
The player command \pc{D..xx} delays the current note, volume or note cut with
\pc{xx} subticks, where \pc{xx} is the number of subticks in hexadecimal
numbers.

\subsubsection{Command \pc{Exxxx}}
The player command \pc{Exxxx} makes a pitch slide down.  The pitch bend value
is decremented by \pc{xxxx} every subtick.  \pc{E0000} repeats the parameter
from the pitch slide on the previous row.

\subsubsection{Command \pc{Fxxxx}}
The player command \pc{Fxxxx} makes a pitch slide up.  The pitch bend value is
incremented by \pc{xxxx} every subtick.  \pc{F0000} repeats the parameter from
the pitch slide on the previous row.

\subsubsection{Command \pc{P....}}
The player command \pc{P....} will send a MIDI program change message corresponding
to the settings in the current instrument.

\subsubsection{Command \pc{Q..xx}}
The player command \pc{Q..xx} will retrigger the note once every \pc{xx} subticks.

\subsubsection{Command \pc{R..xx}}
The player command \pc{R..xx} will start the arpeggio \pc{xx}.  If \pc{xx} is \pc{00}
the last started arpeggio will be continued.

\subsubsection{Command \pc{Sxxyy}}
The player command \pc{Sxxyy} sets the MIDI continuous controller \pc{xx} to
the value \pc{yy}, where \pc{xx} and \pc{yy} are hexadecimal numbers.  If
\pc{xx} or \pc{yy} are \pc{80} their respective last used values will be used
again.

\subsubsection{Command \pc{T..xx}}
The player command \pc{T..xx} will set the tempo to \pc{xx}, where \pc{xx} is
the tempo in hexadecimal numbers.  The minimum allowed tempo is 60 bpm
(\pc{3C}), and the maximum tempo is 240 bpm (\pc{F0}).

\subsubsection{Command \pc{Wxxxx}}
The player command \pc{Wxxxx} sets the pitch bend to \pc{xxxx}, where \pc{xxxx}
is the desired value in hexadecimal numbers.  \pc{W0000} is maximum down,
\pc{W3FFF} is maximum up, and \pc{W2000} is the center position.  \pc{W2000}
is typically used to reset the pitch bend after a pitch slide command.

\subsubsection{Command \pc{X..xx}}
The player command \pc{X..xx} will set panning to \pc{xx}, where \pc{xx} is
the panning in hexadecimal numbers.  \pc{00} is far left, \pc{7F} is far
right, and \pc{40} is center. (this command does the same as \pc{S0Axx})

\subsubsection{Command \pc{Zxxyy}}
The player command \pc{Zxxyy} will send the midimacro \pc{xx}, with the optional
parameter \pc{yy}.  If \pc{xx} is \pc{00} the last used midimacro will be used again.
If \pc{yy} is \pc{00} the last used value will be used again.

\begin{tablist}{\pcwidth}
\hline
\pc{A..xx} & Set TPB (ticks per beat) \\

\pc{Cxxxx} & Pattern break - setting the \pc{C} marker denotes the end of a 
         pattern.  ex: \pc{C0000} will skip to the next pattern, row 0 \\
 
\pc{D..xx} & Delay note/volume/cut - by \pc{xxxx} sub-ticks. \\
 
\pc{Exxxx} & Pitch slide down, \pc{E0000} will repeat the last portamento command. \\
 
\pc{Fxxxx} & Pitch slide up, \pc{F0000} will repeat the last portamento down command. \\
 
\pc{P....} & Send program change message for the current instrument. \\
 
\pc{Q..xx} & Retrig note every \pc{xx} subticks \\
 
\pc{R..xx} & Start arpeggio \pc{xx}.  \pc{R0000} will continue the last arpeggio \\

\pc{Sxxyy} & \pc{xx} is the CC (Continuous Controller) number, \pc{yy} is the value
             (\pc{00}-\pc{80}).  ex. \pc{S0142} will set CC \pc{01} (Mod Wheel) to a
             value of \pc{42}.  $>=$\pc{80} sends last value \\
 
\pc{T..xx} & Set tempo to \pc{xx} bpm \\
 
\pc{Wxxxx} & Absolute pitch set, between \pc{0000} and \pc{3FFF}, \pc{2000} is no pitch change, 
         \pc{0000} is max down, \pc{3FFF} is max up  \\
 
\pc{X..xx} & Set panning, \pc{00}=left, \pc{40}=center, \pc{7F}=right \\

\pc{Zxxyy} & Send midimacro \pc{xx} with parameter \pc{yy}.
             \pc{00} repeats the last used value \\

\section{Keyboard Shortcuts}
These are the key commands.  Note that name of the keys is from an american keyboard layout,
but it is their position that counts.  I.e some key names are different if you have a
keyboard layout of another country.

\section{Loading}
Pressing \key{CTRL-F9} switches to the load page.  Here you may select a file for
loading.  Press \key{Enter}, or click twice on the file you wish to load.  If you
have edited the song currently in memory, you will be asked if you wish to lose
those edits.  \ztracker{} loads \fname{.zt} files.  Further if the file you select
has the \fname{.it} extension, \ztracker{} will try to import it as an
Impulse Tracker song.  \sectionref{sec:importing_it_songs}

\section{Saving}
Pressing \key{CTRL-F10} switches to the save page.  Here you may select a
directory and file name for your song file.  Find the correct directory by using the
cursor keys and \key{Tab} to cycle through the windows (or use the mouse).  Then
enter the desired file name into the text box below the file name selector, and
press \key{Enter} to save. If the file already exists, you will be asked if you
wish to overwrite the previous file.    You can also select an already existing
file by selecting it as in the load page. \\
There are two boxes just below the file name text box, selecting if a 
\fname{.zt} file or a \fname{.mid} file shall be created.  This must always be
\fname{.zt} for \ztracker{} to be able to load the resulting file. Selecting
\fname{.mid} makes \ztracker{} export a MIDI file.
