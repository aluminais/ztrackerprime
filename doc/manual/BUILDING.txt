Building the ztracker manual
----------------------------
Written by Daniel Kahlin <tlr@users.sourceforge.net>

Required software:
- MiKTeX 2.0 or later (or any other latex distribution including tex and pdftex)
  (http://www.miktex.org/)

For rebuilding autogenerated files:
- Perl 5.003 or later.  (For Win32 ActivePerl is recommended, ActivePerl 5.6.1
  Build 629 tested) (http://www.activestate.com/)

For converting graphics into ps (needed for viewing png-graphics in Yap):
- NetPBM. (For Win32 the GnuWin32 versions are the only ones that are tested)
  (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/)   You need atleast pngtopnm and pnmtops.

For building HTML this is needed:
- Hevea for win32 1.05 or later
  (http://facweb.arch.ohio-state.edu/pviton/support/hevea.html)

Installing
----------
1. install MikTeX.  (Release 2.1 provides an automatic setup tool which downloads
   what is required.  Choose 'small installation'.)
2. Unpack hevea to c:\hevea.
3. Add MikTeX and Hevea to your path.  (c:\texmf\miktex\bin;c:\hevea)
4. create a new directory: mkdir c:\localtexmf\tex\latex\hevea
5. copy c:\hevea\hevea.sty to C:\localtexmf\tex\latex\hevea
6. rebuild the filename database by running "initexmf -u"

Working on the manual
-----------------------
1. From a MS-DOS prompt, cd to the manual directory
2. run "texify zt-manual.tex"
3. run "yap zt-manual.dvi" (this displays the document)
4. Done!
yap will stay running, and update the document view automatically the next time
you run texify.

Building the pdf-manual
-----------------------
1. From a MS-DOS prompt, cd to the manual directory
2. run "pdflatex zt-manual.tex"
3. run "pdflatex zt-manual.tex" again. (this ensures that the index is correctly built)
4. Done! (the pdf-manual is zt-manual.pdf)

Information about LaTeX
-----------------------
The LaTeX 2e Reference included in the MiKTeX distribution is good. 

Be sure to read the freely downloadable "The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX 2e"
by Tobias Oetiker, Hubert Partl, Irene Hyna and Elisabeth Schlegl.
(ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf)

"The LaTeX Companion" by Michel Goossens, Frank Mittelbach and Alexander Samarin,
Second Printing, 1994, Addison Wesley, ISBN 0-201-54199-8 is a good book about writing
LaTeX.

Check the TeX Users Group pages for info (http://www.tug.org).
