Building required libraries
---------------------------

You can find the source to these libraries on the required devel files section of the ztracker
sourceforge download page. 

If you want to compile zt, you will need these build libraries and the include files that 
come with all their respective packages.  These pre-built binaries are here only for
convienience. (so you dont have to build them yourself)
